              The first ever video game to have been created was Pong in 1958 which, for its time was, was a masterpiece and even now-a-days people still play this game on browser. Pong was created for use on an arcade machine as consoles were yet to be created. Other famous arcade game titles were Pacman, Space Invaders, Galaga and Donkey Kong. But the first real game that hit the world stage would only come just over 30 years later, with the creation of Super Mario Bros for the Nintendo Entertainment System console, or NES for short. This game is a classic and is very well known due to the Mario Brothers series being one of the most popular video game series to this day. Nintendo was one of the first companies to conquer the world stage of video game development and thus became one of the leading video game and console producers. Another one of these giants is Sega, though they are no longer as well known for their games. They created many games with large followings such as Sonic, Mortal Combat and Street Fighter. One thing that all of these games have in common is the fact that they are offline games, as the internet was only up and coming during those times. With the creation of the internet however, games rapidly evolved and a new type of game was created as a result: Online multiplayer games. Online multiplayer games are staples of modern video games and these types of games became even more well known due to their coverage of high level players competing against each other to become the best.
